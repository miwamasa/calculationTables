 *
 * The TLS Handshake Protocol involves the following steps:
 *
 * - Exchange hello messages to agree on algorithms, exchange random values,
 * and check for session resumption.
 *
 * - Exchange the necessary cryptographic parameters to allow the client and
 * server to agree on a premaster secret.
 *
 * - Exchange certificates and cryptographic information to allow the client
 * and server to authenticate themselves.
 *
 * - Generate a master secret from the premaster secret and exchanged random
 * values.
 *
 * - Provide security parameters to the record layer.
 *
 * - Allow the client and server to verify that their peer has calculated the
 * same security parameters and that the handshake occurred without tampering
 * by an attacker.
 *
 * Up to 4 different messages may be sent during a key exchange. The server
 * certificate, the server key exchange, the client certificate, and the
 * client key exchange.
 *
 * A typical handshake (from the client's perspective).
 *
 * 1. Client sends ClientHello.
 * 2. Client receives ServerHello.
 * 3. Client receives optional Certificate.
 * 4. Client receives optional ServerKeyExchange.
 * 5. Client receives ServerHelloDone.
 * 6. Client sends optional Certificate.
 * 7. Client sends ClientKeyExchange.
 * 8. Client sends optional CertificateVerify.
 * 9. Client sends ChangeCipherSpec.
 * 10. Client sends Finished.
 * 11. Client receives ChangeCipherSpec.
 * 12. Client receives Finished.
 * 13. Client sends/receives application data.
 *
 * To reuse an existing session:
 *
 * 1. Client sends ClientHello with session ID for reuse.
 * 2. Client receives ServerHello with same session ID if reusing.
 * 3. Client receives ChangeCipherSpec message if reusing.
 * 4. Client receives Finished.
 * 5. Client sends ChangeCipherSpec.
 * 6. Client sends Finished.
 *
 * Note: Client ignores HelloRequest if in the middle of a handshake.
 *
 * Record Layer:
 *
 * The record layer fragments information blocks into TLSPlaintext records
 * carrying data in chunks of 2^14 bytes or less. Client message boundaries are
 * not preserved in the record layer (i.e., multiple client messages of the
 * same ContentType MAY be coalesced into a single TLSPlaintext record, or a
 * single message MAY be fragmented across several records).
 *
 * struct {
 *   uint8 major;
 *   uint8 minor;
 * } ProtocolVersion;
 *
 * struct {
 *   ContentType type;
 *   ProtocolVersion version;
 *   uint16 length;
 *   opaque fragment[TLSPlaintext.length];
 * } TLSPlaintext;
 *
 * type:
 *   The higher-level protocol used to process the enclosed fragment.
 *
 * version:
 *   The version of the protocol being employed. TLS Version 1.2 uses version
 *   {3, 3}. TLS Version 1.0 uses version {3, 1}. Note that a client that
 *   supports multiple versions of TLS may not know what version will be
 *   employed before it receives the ServerHello.
 *
 * length:
 *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSPlaintext.fragment. The length
 *   MUST NOT exceed 2^14 = 16384 bytes.
 *
 * fragment:
 *   The application data. This data is transparent and treated as an
 *   independent block to be dealt with by the higher-level protocol specified
 *   by the type field.
 *
 * Implementations MUST NOT send zero-length fragments of Handshake, Alert, or
 * ChangeCipherSpec content types. Zero-length fragments of Application data
 * MAY be sent as they are potentially useful as a traffic analysis
 * countermeasure.
 *
 * Note: Data of different TLS record layer content types MAY be interleaved.
 * Application data is generally of lower precedence for transmission than
 * other content types. However, records MUST be delivered to the network in
 * the same order as they are protected by the record layer. Recipients MUST
 * receive and process interleaved application layer traffic during handshakes
 * subsequent to the first one on a connection.
 *
 * struct {
 *   ContentType type;       // same as TLSPlaintext.type
 *   ProtocolVersion version;// same as TLSPlaintext.version
 *   uint16 length;
 *   opaque fragment[TLSCompressed.length];
 * } TLSCompressed;
 *
 * length:
 *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSCompressed.fragment.
 *   The length MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 1024.
 *
 * fragment:
 *   The compressed form of TLSPlaintext.fragment.
 *
 * Note: A CompressionMethod.null operation is an identity operation; no fields
 * are altered. In this implementation, since no compression is supported,
 * uncompressed records are always the same as compressed records.
 *
 * Encryption Information:
 *
 * The encryption and MAC functions translate a TLSCompressed structure into a
 * TLSCiphertext. The decryption functions reverse the process. The MAC of the
 * record also includes a sequence number so that missing, extra, or repeated
 * messages are detectable.
 *
 * struct {
 *   ContentType type;
 *   ProtocolVersion version;
 *   uint16 length;
 *   select (SecurityParameters.cipher_type) {
 *     case stream: GenericStreamCipher;
 *     case block:  GenericBlockCipher;
 *     case aead:   GenericAEADCipher;
 *   } fragment;
 * } TLSCiphertext;
 *
 * type:
 *   The type field is identical to TLSCompressed.type.
 *
 * version:
 *   The version field is identical to TLSCompressed.version.
 *
 * length:
 *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSCiphertext.fragment.
 *   The length MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 2048.
 *
 * fragment:
 *   The encrypted form of TLSCompressed.fragment, with the MAC.
 *
 * Note: Only CBC Block Ciphers are supported by this implementation.
 *
 * The TLSCompressed.fragment structures are converted to/from block
 * TLSCiphertext.fragment structures.
 *
 * struct {
 *   opaque IV[SecurityParameters.record_iv_length];
 *   block-ciphered struct {
 *     opaque content[TLSCompressed.length];
 *     opaque MAC[SecurityParameters.mac_length];
 *     uint8 padding[GenericBlockCipher.padding_length];
 *     uint8 padding_length;
 *   };
 * } GenericBlockCipher;
 *
 * The MAC is generated as described in Section 6.2.3.1.
 *
 * IV:
 *   The Initialization Vector (IV) SHOULD be chosen at random, and MUST be
 *   unpredictable. Note that in versions of TLS prior to 1.1, there was no
 *   IV field, and the last ciphertext block of the previous record (the "CBC
 *   residue") was used as the IV. This was changed to prevent the attacks
 *   described in [CBCATT]. For block ciphers, the IV length is of length
 *   SecurityParameters.record_iv_length, which is equal to the
 *   SecurityParameters.block_size.
 *
 * padding:
 *   Padding that is added to force the length of the plaintext to be an
 *   integral multiple of the block cipher's block length. The padding MAY be
 *   any length up to 255 bytes, as long as it results in the
 *   TLSCiphertext.length being an integral multiple of the block length.
 *   Lengths longer than necessary might be desirable to frustrate attacks on
 *   a protocol that are based on analysis of the lengths of exchanged
 *   messages. Each uint8 in the padding data vector MUST be filled with the
 *   padding length value. The receiver MUST check this padding and MUST use
 *   the bad_record_mac alert to indicate padding errors.
 *
 * padding_length:
 *   The padding length MUST be such that the total size of the
 *   GenericBlockCipher structure is a multiple of the cipher's block length.
 *   Legal values range from zero to 255, inclusive. This length specifies the
 *   length of the padding field exclusive of the padding_length field itself.
 *
 * The encrypted data length (TLSCiphertext.length) is one more than the sum of
 * SecurityParameters.block_length, TLSCompressed.length,
 * SecurityParameters.mac_length, and padding_length.
 *
 * Example: If the block length is 8 bytes, the content length
 * (TLSCompressed.length) is 61 bytes, and the MAC length is 20 bytes, then the
 * length before padding is 82 bytes (this does not include the IV. Thus, the
 * padding length modulo 8 must be equal to 6 in order to make the total length
 * an even multiple of 8 bytes (the block length). The padding length can be
 * 6, 14, 22, and so on, through 254. If the padding length were the minimum
 * necessary, 6, the padding would be 6 bytes, each containing the value 6.
 * Thus, the last 8 octets of the GenericBlockCipher before block encryption
 * would be xx 06 06 06 06 06 06 06, where xx is the last octet of the MAC.
 *
 * Note: With block ciphers in CBC mode (Cipher Block Chaining), it is critical
 * that the entire plaintext of the record be known before any ciphertext is
 * transmitted. Otherwise, it is possible for the attacker to mount the attack
 * described in [CBCATT].
 *
 * Implementation note: Canvel et al. [CBCTIME] have demonstrated a timing
 * attack on CBC padding based on the time required to compute the MAC. In
 * order to defend against this attack, implementations MUST ensure that
 * record processing time is essentially the same whether or not the padding
 * is correct. In general, the best way to do this is to compute the MAC even
 * if the padding is incorrect, and only then reject the packet. For instance,
 * if the pad appears to be incorrect, the implementation might assume a
 * zero-length pad and then compute the MAC. This leaves a small timing
 * channel, since MAC performance depends, to some extent, on the size of the
 * data fragment, but it is not believed to be large enough to be exploitable,
 * due to the large block size of existing MACs and the small size of the
 * timing signal.

/**
 * Generates pseudo random bytes by mixing the result of two hash functions,

 *
 * prf_TLS1(secret, label, seed) =
 *   P_MD5(S1, label + seed) XOR P_SHA-1(S2, label + seed);
 *
 * Each P_hash function functions as follows:

 * P_hash(secret, seed) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(1) + seed) +

 * A() is defined as:
 *   A(0) = seed
 *   A(i) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(i-1))
 *
 * The '+' operator denotes concatenation.
 *
 * As many iterations A(N) as are needed are performed to generate enough
 * pseudo random byte output. If an iteration creates more data than is
 * necessary, then it is truncated.
 *
 * Therefore:
 * A(1) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(0))
 *      = HMAC_hash(secret, seed)
 * A(2) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(1))
